# Video-Game-Archive
The video game archive is a dynamic site that allows registered users to access a central library 
of games that at a click of a button can be added to their own personal library's to track.  
All data us stored in a database thru Mysql server that contains three tables.
One for users, for verification and login.
One for The games in the main central libray, The games have displays, release dates, region, console, and short descriptions.
And finally the last table being for the useres own personal library. Once you click the button to add a game from the central library 
to your own personal one, the record of that game is copied and transferred over to the personal library table.
The site handles empty personal librarys by telling telling users to go to the central library/archive to add games,
and provides acces to it with buttons on both the main screen or personal library screen. 
Once a user is done there is a logout button is logout users.
